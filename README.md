# ISO3166-codes
A somewhat comprehensive ISO3166 codes list, with country/territory information and a bit more (latest population estimates, GDP). Mostly because I keep on re-inventing the wheel every time. And the algorithm that I used to create the list, in case you want to edit.

**Note**: I am not doing any politics here, merely describing a physical location in space with corresponding information. The name I use is *country/territory*.

Also, please note a problem with the iso3166-alpha 2 code for Namibia. It is empty because .. `R`. (In other words, replace it with NA if you are going to use it. I would recommend alpha 3's, though.)
