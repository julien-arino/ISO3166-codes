# ISO3166-codes
A somewhat comprehensive ISO3166 codes list, with country/territory information and a bit more (latest population estimates, GDP). Mostly because I keep on re-inventing the wheel every time. And the algorithm that I used to create the list, in case you want to edit.

**Note**: I am not doing any politics here, merely describing a physical location in space with corresponding information. The name I use is *country/territory*.
